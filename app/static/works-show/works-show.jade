		.description
			p MKTMix was a great challenge for me. I did an MVC framework by myself, and a Navigation library to listen when the pages animation finished and started, so I can change the hash url. The animations were made in a way that all the circles follows the same pattern, scaling up and down. All the circle buttons has the same animation using a jquery plugin made just for this purpose. All the data is retrieved from the server-side as json. and manipulated in the front-end. Unfortunately, there are more sections that I canÂ´t show, because they are restricted to logged users.
